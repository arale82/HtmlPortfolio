  <h1>Alessia Dallera - My Resume</h1>
  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    I have been a web developer for about 10 years from 2001 to 2012. I worked in the north of Italy as an employee for three small companies.<br/>
    Then, I had two children, we moved to London (UK), we had another child and I focused on my growing family and volounteering my knowledge in information technologies with charities around my area; especially with the local school and PTA.<br/>
    My passion for information technology and for web design and development never stopped so, in 2023, I have decided to return to my laptop and re-start what I left behind all those years ago.<br/>
    The course I found, is a comprehensive beginner course for Web Developer. I have chosen this course because I want to refresh my memory on the languages I already know (HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, JAVA) and I am curious to learn about the tools and languages available now.</p>
  <p>My goal is to be able to write a modern website/app to add to my portfolio and, in the near future, restart my career as web developer.</p>
